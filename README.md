## 📚 About

Welcome to my **Monopoly Remake** project! This is my re-creation of the classic **Monopoly** board game, developed using **React** and styled with **Bootstrap**. The project offers a dynamic and interactive game board experience.

🔧 **Current Status**:  
This project is still under development and is not fully playable yet. While it’s not fully optimized for mobile or tablet devices, the game is fully functional on desktop/web browsers. You can explore the ongoing work in progress below.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
The following improvements are planned for the future development of the game:

- **Complete Gameplay Mechanics**: I will implement all core gameplay features, including the ability to:
  - Buy properties
  - Mortgage properties
  - Trade properties with other players
  - Implement the chance and community chest cards
  - Handle bankruptcies and other in-game events

- **AI Implementation**: Once the game mechanics are complete, I plan to implement an AI system that will allow players to play against CPU-controlled opponents. The AI will be designed to mimic human-like decisions and strategies during the game.

Stay tuned for these updates and more as development continues!

### Note on Playability:
While this game is still a work in progress, it already showcases several core features of the original Monopoly game. Stay tuned for more updates and the addition of complete game mechanics.
